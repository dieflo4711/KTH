The goal of the project is to build a simple search engine for natural language text
documents.
When completed the search engine will support the following operations:

• Index documents based on their content.

• Find and list documents which contain a single provided key word.

• Order search results by different properties (e.g. relevance, popularity).

• Use a query language to support more involved searches.
